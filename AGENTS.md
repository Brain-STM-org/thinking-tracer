# AGENTS: `thinking-trace-viewer`

## Project Overview

`thinking-trace-viewer` is allows for the visualization of LLM conversations.  It allows a user to dissect a conversation (it's "trace"):  the prompts, the resultant thinking, the output, and the metadata.  This is intended for 3D environments, so we will use WebGL (or WebGPU) in a web page.  It is a user interface component that can be embedded in other applications.  We include a sample program that a user can run locally and drag-and-drop their conversations and view it.

We hope to support multiple agents, but we will start with Claude Code files.
