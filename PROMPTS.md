I want you to research on the web how people use ampcode (https://ampcode.com/) traces and what they find most useful about it.  create a short report about it and include it in AGENTS.md as analysis for good design and feature ideas.

## 2026-01-22T22:33:57Z

proceed with project scaffolding.  i also like to use Taskfile, so maintain a Taskfile.yml

---

## 2026-01-22T22:45:37Z

check the git staging for anything that seems like a temporary or build file

---

## 2026-01-22T22:47:15Z

Add a buttom to select a file in addition to the drag-and-drop

---

## 2026-01-22T22:54:11Z

i'm in dark mode, the upper corner rectangle "thinking trace viewer" is barely visible

---

## 2026-01-22T22:55:29Z

hmm, still looks faint in my dark mode

---

## 2026-01-22T22:58:55Z

---

## 2026-01-22T23:12:57Z

much better!  great work.   now onto functionality, which Claude Code JSON file should i drop?

---

make a legend for the different node colors.  we will want to display a summary of the content in their 3D space , but we can also have click-testing and have a side panel with concrete details of selection

---

## 2026-01-23T00:26:54Z

add keyboard navigation through the blocks.

---

## 2026-01-23T00:29:38Z

create a palette of recently used traces, you can store it in an appropriate local storage mechanism

---

## 2026-01-23T00:32:24Z

add a way to go back to the selection screen

---

## 2026-01-23T00:34:56Z

is there any interesting session metadata to display in the session box?   

---

## 2026-01-23T00:40:45Z

it's really annoying to see this long line of traces.  can we curl them up so we can have clusters of traces floating around and unfurl them?  research how that has generally done with graphs in UX research and suggest how we would do it here

---

## 2026-01-23T00:48:48Z

yes, do phase 1

---

## 2026-01-23T00:56:30Z

can we expand the selected cluster in the info panel?

---

## 2026-01-23T00:58:22Z

i would like you to list everything in the cluster in the details pane

---

## 2026-01-23T01:02:09Z

that's working well... i like the spiral coil.  we need it to take less space vertically, can we compress the coil on each end and shave it uncoiled in the area of focus, kinda like a slinky
